# smartLight
It a little arduino based project where I can turn on and off my light from my phone. Plus it turn on the light when the alarm goes off. I made it so when the alarm goes off I have to go the the alarm box and push the button to turn off the alarm. which takes the sleep away. Alarm can not be turned of from the phone.  I also used a lcd screen which displays the time and the date. I used arduino clock module ds3231, which keep the track of the time and send it to ardino which then displays it on the lcd. The module takes a little battery so in case if the arduino stops getting power the time won't be restarted. It will keep on going. The arduino is connected to the phone by bluetooth. I use and arduino bluetooth app to send data in. I use 0 for turn off and 1 to turn on.
